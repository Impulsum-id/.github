🍿 **Project Description** <br>
App to help home owners to plan of renovation through visualization of the materials in real time using AR
<br>
Our visualization app helps new homeowners who are planning to renovate their newly bought house but struggle to visualize how sample materials from the store will look when applied in their space. By enabling users to see the materials in full application on walls or flooring, our app provides an accurate preview, taking into account the site conditions and lighting for the most realistic representation. 

The main technologies used are Unity and ARFoundation.
